				<h3 class="major">Background</h3>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">
					As an experienced professional with more than 10 years of experience at
					the University of the Free
					State, I have developed a diverse skill set in applied science, research, data analytics, data
					science, and programming. I have a proven track record of leveraging data-driven insights to solve
					complex problems and make informed decisions.<br><br>

					Currently, I am responsible for driving analytics for student success at our institution, in
					partnership with both the Kresge and Michael Susan Dell Foundation. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I
					played a critical role in tracking online engagement for over 40,000 students to ensure that
					teaching and learning was taking place effectively. Over the course of the pandemic, I wrote 65
					reports that served as valuable resources for top management in making informed decisions.
					Leveraging my expertise in data analytics, I developed statistical models and machine learning
					algorithms to analyze structured and unstructured data and build predictive models. Through these
					initiatives, we were able to identify students who were at risk of falling behind and provide them
					with targeted support. My ability to work effectively under pressure and adapt to rapidly changing
					circumstances was essential in ensuring the success of these initiatives.<br><br>

					Throughout my career, I have designed and executed experiments, analyzed data, and drawn conclusions
					based on statistical analysis. A defining opportunity in my career was conducting applied
					biotechnology research for our University's industrial partners at the Metagenomics Platform. As
					part of a multidisciplinary project team, I conceptualized and commercialized novel technologies
					that we developed, co-authored publications and patents, and presented our findings at conferences.
					My ability to communicate technical concepts effectively to both technical and non-technical
					stakeholders was essential in securing funding for these projects and fostering productive
					relationships with our industry partners.<br><br>

					Overall, I am a well-rounded professional who is equipped with the knowledge, skills, and tools to
					deliver high-quality results in a fast-paced and dynamic work environment. I am confident that my
					experience and expertise make me highly employable and I look forward to discussing how I can
					contribute to your team.<br><br>

				<h2 class="major">Key Projects</h2>
				<p>Here are a few spotlights of my most impactful work. More details can be found in the skill-specific
					sections.</p>

				<h3 style="text-align: left;">NBT Predictive Algorithm & Automation Bot</h3>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">
					<strong>Problem:</strong> During the pandemic, many students couldn't take the compulsory National
					Benchmark Test (NBT) for financial reasons, blocking them from registration.
					<br>
					<strong>Solution:</strong> I developed a Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) algorithm to predict
					student academic literacy scores, allowing for exemptions. I then built a Python email bot to
					automate the generation and sending of 1,000+ personalized HTML notification emails per minute.
					<br>
					<strong>Impact:</strong> Processed over 150,000 applications, achieved 85% out-of-sample accuracy,
					and reduced a task that took four people weeks to just eight minutes. The algorithm is now
					institutionalized in the University's General Rules.
				</p>

				<h3 style="text-align: left;">Michael Susan Dell Foundation (MSDF) Student Success Algorithms</h3>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">
					<strong>Problem:</strong> The university needed a robust, scalable system to proactively identify
					at-risk students and track their progress toward career-readiness.
					<br>
					<strong>Solution:</strong> I authored all the core algorithms for a R170 million, 7-year
					partnership. This included the "Scaled Responsive Student Tracking" algorithm (an advanced early
					warning system) and the "Employability Tracking Algorithm" which pulls, integrates, and analyzes
					data to award badges as students hit milestones.
					<br>
					<strong>Impact:</strong> These algorithms form the foundation of the university's next-generation
					student success and retention strategy, directly improving graduation rates and securing a major
					long-term institutional partnership.
				</p>

				<h3 style="text-align: left;">COVID-19 Engagement Analytics (40,000+ Students)</h3>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">
					<strong>Problem:</strong> At the start of the pandemic, top management had no visibility into
					whether teaching and learning were happening effectively online for over 40,000 students.
					<br>
					<strong>Solution:</strong> I led the tracking and analysis of all online engagement (LMS access,
					video sessions, assessment completion, etc.). I authored 65 detailed reports that were delivered
					directly to top management and our rector.
					<br>
					<strong>Impact:</strong> The reports became a national DHET reporting requirement, were presented to
					the Minister of Higher Education, significantly reduced the University's risk score, and led to
					multi-million Rand subsidies.

			<article id="data-analytics">
				<h2 class="major">Data analytics</h2>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/tableau.png" alt="" /></span>

				<p>Below is some of high impact <b>analyses</b> I conducted since Covid started:

				<ul>
					<li style="text-align: justify;">Learning Management System analytics: During the Covid pandemic, I
						played a crucial role in monitoring and analyzing the online engagement of over 40,000 students
						at our institution. Through detailed tracking of student access, activity, video sessions,
						assessment completion/marks, and content behavior, I provided valuable insights that allowed
						management to make data-driven decisions during the uncertainty of the pandemic. My efforts
						resulted in the creation of 65 reports, which were used by top management to gain a better
						understanding of student engagement and learning outcomes. One of the reports were presented to
						the Minister of Higher Education by our rector.

					</li><br>
					<li style="text-align: justify;">Predictive analytics: Identifying
						students who are at risk of failing and calculating their risk profile. Using a variety
						of data sets, I have continuously analyzed student data to find leading indicators that allow
						our institution to proactively intervene before students fall behind. This has resulted in the
						creation of the innovative "No-Student-Left-Behind" algorithm, which is capable of accurately
						predicting which students are most likely to require additional support to succeed. Through
						rigorous cross-validation techniques, I have verified the efficacy of this algorithm, ensuring
						that it can effectively predict student performance and provide timely interventions to prevent
						academic failure.

					</li><br>
					<li style="text-align: justify;">A/B testing pilot: Conducted an experiment to analyze the
						effectiveness of nudging students to
						online support resources. Our group designed and implemented the pilot study, including the
						selection of
						the experimental groups and control groups, as well as the collection and analysis of data. The
						results provided valuable insights into which resources students respond best to, which informed
						the development of future interventions and support services.</li><br>
					<li style="text-align: justify;">Correlation study: Developed a framework for defining student
						success in higher education by
						conducted a correlation analysis to identify key factors that contribute to the definition of
						success.
						This study
						involved gathering and analyzing data from multiple sources as well as reviewing multiple
						definitions in literature. By identifying significant correlations,
						we were able to refine our definition of student success and create a more effective early
						warning system for at-risk students.</li><br>
					<li style="text-align: justify;">Outlier detection experiments: As the educational landscape
						constantly evolves, traditional
						rule-based approaches to nudging students may not always be effective. Through a series of
						outlier detection experiments, we were able to refine our credit load nudging approach by
						dynamically adjusting for outliers. By identifying patterns in students' operational data, we
						were able to
						create a more accurate and effective approach to nudging that accounts for unique student
						registration combinations.</li><br>

					<li style="text-align: justify;">Developmental modules impact analyses: I conducted a comprehensive
						impact analysis of
						developmental modules, evaluating their positive effects on the academic and non-academic
						experiences of students, particularly those from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds. This
						involved analyzing various data sets and identifying key performance indicators to assess the
						impact of the modules on student success. The findings were used to develop evidence-based
						recommendations to management. Each of these module annually generates more than R20 million in
						tuition fees for the University, making them
						financially beneficial. But more importantly, these modules have a direct positive impact on
						addressing
						the equity gap in our country by providing necessary support for students who come from
						disadvantaged backgrounds.</li><br>
				</ul>

			<article id="data-science">
				<h2 class="major">Data Science</h2>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/text-mining.JPG" alt="" /></span>
				<p>Below is some of main <b>algorithms</b> I wrote since Covid started:

				<ul>National Benchmark Test (NBT) algorithm and email bot:

					<ul>
						<li style="text-align: justify;">Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) algorithm: Developed an
							algorithm to predict the Academic
							Literacy Scores of students who were unable to take the National Benchmark Test (NBT) due to
							financial reasons during the pandemic. The goal of the algorithm was not to measure literacy
							but to predict it, allowing students to be exempt from the otherwise compulsory literacy
							module.</li>

						<li style="text-align: justify;">Code generation algorithm: To streamline the process of
							notifying students of their results,
							I also created an email bot that generates personalized HTML code for emails based on the
							algorithm's output. The bot switches between support services email accounts and sends 1,000
							customized emails per minute, completing a task that previously took four people weeks to
							complete in just eight minutes. Students then only have to click "reply" to reach the
							correct support service staff member. </li>
					</ul>
				</ul>


				<ul>The Michael Susan Dell (MSDF) Foundation funded algorithms:
					<ul>
						<li style="text-align: justify;">The MSDF's Scaled Responsive Student Tracking algorithm: I
							wrote
							this algorithm with all the lessons learned from our "No-Student-Left-Behind" analyses,
							algorithms and
							tools. This algorithm serves as an enhanced early warning response system that effectively
							provides
							support to students when they need it the most, resulting in improved retention and success
							rates. By identifying and addressing potential issues in a timely manner, we were able to
							create a more inclusive and supportive learning environment that benefits both the students
							and the
							university. The algorithm has also had a positive impact on the university's subsidies, as
							the government incentivize graduation.
						</li>
						<li style="text-align: justify;">The MSDF's Career Development and Employability Tracking
							Algorithm: As part of the
							University's mission to empower students with career development skills, I developed an
							algorithm that pulls, integrates, and analyzes data on how far each student has progressed
							through the employability pathway. The algorithm then awards badges to students when they
							achieve core milestones, providing recognition and encouragement for their efforts. To
							ensure accessibility and ease of use, the algorithm generates HTML code that is uploaded to
							Blackboard, allowing students to easily track their progress towards achieving
							employability.
						</li>

					</ul>
				</ul>
				<ul>Energia (machine learning powered productivity web app):
					<ul>
						<li style="text-align: justify;">Dependencies management algorithm: Manage
							interrelated tasks and resources to ensure efficient overall project completion.</li>
						<li style="text-align: justify;">Prioritization algorithm: Weighting of the tickets according to
							a model.</li>
						<li style="text-align: justify;">Prediction algorithm:
							Forecast the time needed to complete a project based on
							historical data and other factors.</li>
						<li style="text-align: justify;">Scheduling algorithms: Intelligent scheduling that takes the

					</ul>
				</ul>
				<ul>Institutional algorithms:
					<ul>
						<li style="text-align: justify;">Hierarchical clustering algorithm:
							To address the issue of equity gap among our students, we needed to identify and support
							underserved students. To achieve this, I developed a Hierarchical Clustering algorithm to
							analyze data and uncover patterns that could help us identify these students. This algorithm
							helped us segment our student population and by using the
							insights gained from the clustering algorithm, we were able to provide targeted
							interventions to these students and reduce the equity gap.
						</li>
						<li style="text-align: justify;">Review Index algorithm:
							Review Index algorithm: To determine which students could be brought back to campus via
							permits while adhering to social distancing guidelines and classroom capacity restrictions,
							a review committee was formed at the university. However, due to data not being integrated
							at the time, I created an algorithm that had to search for and gather data from multiple
							datasets to rank students based on their current level of "risk". The algorithm used a point
							system to generate a Review Index score for each student, which helped the committee make
							more informed decisions.

						</li>
						<li style="text-align: justify;">Text mining algorithm:
							To further support the Review Index algorithm in identifying students
							who were at risk and needed to be prioritized for campus permits during the pandemic, I
							developed a text mining algorithm. This algorithm analyzed the self-reported reasons that
							students provided for being at risk, extracted key phrases and topics, and identified common
							themes and concerns. By doing so, the algorithm provided valuable insights into the specific
							challenges that students were facing, such as health issues, financial difficulties, or
							transportation problems, which could then be addressed by the university's support services.
							This allowed us to better understand the needs of our student population and provide
							targeted assistance to those who needed it the most.

						</li>
						<li style="text-align: justify;">Selenium bot:
							A bot created by Python's Selenium library is a software program that automates web browsing
							tasks such as interacting with web elements and web pages, filling out forms, clicking
							buttons, and extracting data.
							We created the bot for web scraping and automating repetitive tasks on one of our Blackboard
							modules.
							Staff members have to manually extract thousands of student's information by a series of
							clicks on Blackboard.

				<p style="text-align: justify;">
					Below is some of main <b>examples</b> that demonstrates my proficiency in programming:
				<ul>
					<li style="text-align: justify;">Data management:
						I developed and maintain the SQL and Python code that powers
						the NBT algorithm. By leveraging our on-site data warehouse, we are able to extract data in
						real-time, ensuring that the most up-to-date information is available for the predictions.
					</li><br>
					<li style="text-align: justify;">Data processing:
						I utilize Python as my primary tool for working with data. I
						leverage core libraries such as Pandas, Statsmodels, and Scikit-learn to preprocess data,
						conduct analyses and make predictions.

					</li><br>
					<li style="text-align: justify;">Software development:
						In response to the University's need to keep accurate records of the advising support provided
						to
						students, I led the conceptualization and development of the Learner Case Management (LCM)
						system. I wrote the prototype code in both Python and C# and oversaw a
						two-year testing period to ensure the system was effective and scalable.

						During the testing phase, we focused on normalizing, standardizing, and validating all processes
						and data to ensure the system would integrate seamlessly with the University's advising with
						technology initiatives.
						Thanks to the LCM system, the University now has a reliable and efficient way to track student
						support interactions, providing a platform that integrates with the Michael Susan Dell
						Foundation
						algorithms.

					</li><br>
					<li style="text-align: justify;">SQL queries:
						As the main Blackboard analyst for our University, I have developed expertise in writing complex
						SQL queries to extract data from various sources. Specifically, for our Blackboard analytics, I
						wrote PostgreSQL queries that pulled data from Snowflake, a cloud hosting solution. As we
						integrated additional databases, I translated these queries into SQL Server.

						My ability to navigate different database management systems and write efficient SQL queries has
						been crucial to the success of our Blackboard analytics. By extracting and analyzing data in
						this way, we have been able to gain deeper insights into student engagement, identify areas for
						improvement, and ultimately enhance the learning experience for our students.
					</li><br>

					<li style="text-align: justify;">Natural language processing:
						I have developed several algorithms that extract
						valuable insights from text data. These algorithms include the Review Index algorithm, the LCM
						advise narrative mining algorithm, a
						web scraper, a sentiment analysis tool, and a topic modeling classifier.
						By leveraging natural
						language processing techniques, we are able to
						extract meaningful insights and identify patterns at speeds that would not be possible through
						manual analysis.

					</li><br>
					<li style="text-align: justify;">Multiprocessing programming:
						As the lead developer of the Michael Susan Dell Foundation's student tracking algorithm, I
						implemented multiprocessing programming and message queues to optimize performance and maximize
						core usage.

						By leveraging multiprocessing techniques, we were able to break down the algorithm into smaller,
						more manageable tasks that could be executed in parallel across multiple cores. This approach
						not only reduced processing time but also improved the overall stability and reliability of the
						system.

					</li><br>
					<li style="text-align: justify;">Full stack development:
						I am involved in the entire development cycle of the Michael
						Susan Dell Foundation's student tracking project, from the database layer and application layer
						to the front-end layer.

						My ability to work across the entire stack has allowed me to create cohesive and integrated
						solutions that meet the unique needs of the Michael Susan Dell Foundation's student tracking
						project. By leveraging my expertise in full stack development, we have been able to create a
						system that is efficient, scalable, and user-friendly, providing valuable insights into student
						progress and outcomes.


					</li><br>
					<li style="text-align: justify;">Code generation:
						As the lead developer of the NBT email bot and the Employability Pathway algorithm, I
						implemented code generation techniques to streamline the process of generating HTML code that is
						embedded in other software (Blackboard and Outlook).
						Overall, my expertise in code generation has allowed us to create efficient and effective
						solutions for the NBT email bot and the Employability Pathway algorithm, improving the overall
						user experience and significantly reduce staff time needed to complete these tasks.
					</li><br>
					<li style="text-align: justify;">Data governance:
						As the data officer and system admin for the student success data of our University, I am
						responsible for overseeing our data governance practices and ensuring that we comply with
						regulations for the protection of personal data.

						Furthermore, I am responsible for ensuring that all staff and stakeholders are aware of their
						responsibilities with respect to data protection and privacy. This includes providing ongoing
						support and guidance as needed.
					</li><br>
					<li style="text-align: justify;">Github:
						As part of our analytics development process, we use Github version control to manage all of our
						projects.

						Github provides us with a centralized platform for collaborating on code and data, allowing us
						to track changes, manage issues and pull requests, and ensure that all team members are working
						on the same version of the codebase. This approach also allows us to maintain a detailed history
						of all changes made to our projects, making it easier to identify issues and resolve them
						quickly.
					</li><br>
					<li style="text-align: justify;">Web technologies:
						I have experience with a variety of web technologies, including both
						frontend and backend development.

						I am responsible for creating the frontend interface for Energia in Flask, as well as developing
						much of
						the backend database. This involved working with a
						range of technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and SQL and other
						database management tools for the backend. I have also built this website using Github Pages,
						which involved working
						with web technologies like Markdown, and HTML to create a responsive and user-friendly
						interface.
					</li><br>
					<li style="text-align: justify;">Multi paradigm programming:
						As a programmer with varying experienced in multiple languages, including Racket, Python, SQL
						dialects, C#,
						Golang, Rust, HTML, and JavaScript, I possess a wide range of skills that make me an effective
						developer.

						One key advantage of using multiple languages is that it allows me to think
						flexibly and approach problems from multiple angles. Each language has its own strengths and
						weaknesses, as well as unique syntax and paradigms, which means that I can choose the right tool
						for the job and develop solutions that are both efficient and effective.

						It also allowed me to learn key programming
						concepts and patterns that are common across many different languages, such as object-oriented
						programming, functional programming, and data structures. This has enabled me to quickly learn
						new languages and technologies and to adapt to different coding environments and architectures.

				<p style="text-align: justify;">
					I am the lead data scientist for the Siyaphumelela project at the University of the Free State.
					The project objective I am responsible for is called "Investigate contextualised AI design,
					development and implementation in a higher education environment".
					Below is some of the main <b>examples</b> of work that I have done with artificial intelligence:
				<ul>
					<li style="text-align: justify;">Baby AI project: After the launch of ChatGPT late 2022, the
						University wanted to understand the potential impact
						of Generative Artificial Intelligence on higher education. I spent the first half of 2023 to
						create a small scale version
						of ChatGPT (more precisely a transformer) to understand the inner workings of Large Language
						Models. I used publicly available parallel corpora as well as a study guide from a module called
						"English Academic Literacy for Law" as data
						sets.
						The small LLM I created was fondly called "Baby AI" by my colleagues. The first experiment was
						translation.
						I trained the small LLM to translate the module from English to Afrikaans. The second experiment
						was question-and-answering. We asked
						the small LLM questions about the module and the lecturer helped evaluate whether it was true or
						not. We learned lessons about training time,
						data set size, accuracy and hallucinations. We also noticed the small LLM was obsessed with
						assessments. The lecturer and I discussed how we
						could improve the teaching and learning of the study guide instead of forcing students to only
						focus on
						assessments. I presented the findings at the 2023 SAAIR conference.
					</li>

					<li style="text-align: justify;">Prompt Engineering: Developed a prompt engineering
						crash course in the beginning of 2025 for the
						Center of Teaching and Learning
						as part of our internal capacity development plan. The prompt engineering guide was also turned
						into a workshop. The workshop I presented included
						AI literacy training and explaining the various algorithm to staff members. I was invited in May
						to
						Learner Analytics Institute to present a workshop on "AI-Driven Insights and implementation in
						Higher Education" where I shared best practices.

					</li>
					<li style="text-align: justify;">Generative Artificial Intelligence as an assistant for assessment:
						Currently researching the application of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) to support and
						streamline assessment processes in higher education. The project focuses on Critical
						Academic Literacy at the University of the Free State, investigating whether GAI can provide
						reliable, standardized, and timely feedback on written assessments. The project involves a
						comparative analysis of GAI-generated feedback against facilitator feedback, using thematic and
						textual analysis to evaluate adherence to analytic rubrics and its potential to reduce
						instructor workload. Our abstract has been accepted on 21 October 2025 by the South African
						Journal
						of Higher
						Education for their "AI in Higher Education in Global South" Special edition.

					</li>
					<li style="text-align: justify;">Presented AI workshop to the Council for Higher Education (CHE):
						The Council on Higher Education (CHE) is the steward of quality assurance in South Africa's
						higher education sector, a role that involves processing and analysing vast quantities of
						complex, text-rich data. From institutional accreditation documents and quality audit reports to
						policy papers and student data analysis, the data workload is immense.
						On 21 August 2025 the senior director and I presented a
						4-hour introductory workshop designed to facilitate reflection but also develop practical skills
						to engineer prompts for the CHE context. The objective was to equip staff with the skills to
						utilise Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore how AI could enhance operational efficiencies,
						accelerate data analysis, and enhance decision-making processes, directly supporting the CHE's
						mandate.





					</li>

					<li style="text-align: justify;">AI stress testing:
						I ran several experiments to evaluate the feasibility to scale AI. I started off by evaluating
						paid vendors. The evaluation included
						stress testing API token and request limits. The stress tests revealed that it would be very
						expensive to roll out vendor based LLMs to
						the university's 2700+ modules. It was also difficult to track exact token (tokens used during
						"thinking" mode are not disclosed) use and it poses a risk
						because token use is tied to the payment structure. Next I moved on to a series of Open Source
						model testing.
						I picked a range of models (different authors, different parameter sizes) to conduct an open
						source LLM competency test.
						The competency test involved a logical reasoning, a coding, a decision making, a writing and an
						abstract
						conceptual synthesis test. These test gave us insight into model selection for scaling our
						project.
						The next part of the stress testing was to evaluate hardware limitations and optimizations
						(context length, GPU offload, parameter quantization).
